In this advanced course, you use the skills and ideas developed in the previous courses to create a body of creative work at the intersection of code, art, and design. After an initial "ramp-up" assignment, you'll create projects throughout the semester in an open-ended way: your ideas might (should) shift and change as you get feedback and refine your work. This may result in a single, large-scale project, a series of smaller works, or some combination. The goal is to build a creative practice, a visual and creative language, and to develop finished and well-documented work for your portfolio. To accomplish this, we'll have a series of in-progress critiques throughout the semester as well as individual meetings.

For information about homework, grades, etc, please see `CoursePolicies.md`.

# COURSE POLICIES

For all policies, course description, and calendar, see the [Syllabus](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming3/blob/master/Syllabus.pdf).

## ATTENDANCE  
Because this class will cover so much technical material, and because our process of experimentation and critique is collaborative, attendance is mandatory. You are allowed two absences per semester to use at your discretion – each additional absence will result in your final grade being lowered by ½-letter. Late arrivals will be marked tardy, with 3 tardies equaling one absence. The only exception is severe illness – if this is the case, please let me know as soon as possible and provide a doctor’s note documenting your illness.

## HOMEWORK  
Because this is an advanced course, the majority of the semester will be spent developing independent projects. This means spending lots of time outside of class not just working on making stuff, but also thinking about what you want to make, finding materials and resources needed, figuring out what you need help with, and planning a reasonable timeline to accomplish everything. TLDR: the more time you put into your work, the more you’ll get out.

During the semester, we’ll have individual “studio visits” to discuss your work in progress and to provide technical and conceptual help. We’ll have periodic group critiques with Creative Programming 2, as well as a final crit. During these crits you may have fully-finished work or things in-progress, but these will be the primary point of feedback on your work. You’ll want to consider how you present the work (do you hang prints in the hall or show things onscreen?), what you want to get feedback on, and how you want to explain your project. 

## GRADING  
The goal of all assignments is for you to think and make. Everyone comes from a different background and experience, so I’ll be looking for improvement, curiosity, engagement, and a willingness to experiment. A grading rubric will be provided with each assignment to help you understand what is expected and how you did.

To get a C (an average grade) you should:  

* Put time into your projects each week  
* Complete everything on time  
* Participate in critiques and discussions  

For a B or an A, you should additionally:

* Take risks and try things enthusiastically  
* Be an active and unsolicited participant in critiques and discussions  
* Take assignments beyond their minimum requirements  

Final grades will be determined as follows:  

* Initial ramp-up project: 5%
* Homework: 70%  
* Class participation: 25%

## LEARNING ACCOMMODATIONS  
The goal of this class is for everyone to succeed. Stevens and the VA&T program are dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis. 

If you have any questions about learning accommodations, please don’t hesitate to talk with me during or outside of class.

## PRONOUNS  
As this course includes lots of interaction between students, it’s important for us to create an environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronouns and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform me of the necessary changes. 
 
## INCLUSION STATEMENT  
Stevens and the VA&T program believe that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and creativity. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to me to make alternative arrangements.
